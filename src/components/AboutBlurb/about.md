title: 'More About Me'
---

I'm a current Masters student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), where I'm Computer Science. I'll graduate in May 2022. I'm also Double Husky - having received my Bachelors in Civil Engineering from Neu in 2020.

My interest lies in the intersection of technology and sustainable solutions, primarily in the energy/environment sphere. I'd love to combine my knowledge of software and web development, and my passion for the outdoors.

I love to hike! Like, *really*, love to hike. For months on end.

I thru hiked the 3,100 mile [Continental Divide Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_Trail) in 2021, and the 273 mile [Long Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Trail) in 2020. Currently, I'm scheming to hike the 800 mile [Arizona Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Trail) in late Spring 2022. My Trail Name is Bellows, and I just love to be outside. Ask me about my pack's base weight (currently 12 pounds!).

I love Jazz! If you want to talk bebop, pianists, or horn players - let me know. I've been recently really diggin' on [Bud Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2xMqJH6Z8) for Piano, and [Clifford Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M283JFxesic) for Trumpet.
