title: 'More About Me'

I'm an Associate Software Engineer at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) of MIT and Harvard. At the Broad, I'm a part of the Translational Genomics Group, and am working on  the gnomAD browser, which seeks to aggregate and share both the data and tools to analyze, hundreds of thousands of sequenced human genomes to the wider scientific community.

I'm a Double Husky, having received my Master of Science in Computer Science in the May of 2022, and my Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering in May of 2020, from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in Boston, Massachusetts.

I love to hike! Like, *really*, love to hike. For months on end.

I thru hiked the 3,100 mile [Continental Divide Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_Trail) in 2021, and the 273 mile [Long Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Trail) in 2020. My Trail Name is Bellows, and I love to be in the backcountry. Ask me about my pack's base weight (currently 12 pounds!). I also biked ~4,300 miles in 49 days from from Washington, D.C. to Astoria, Oregon in 2022. I took the [Eastern Express](https://www.easternexpressroute.com/) route until meeting up with the traditional [Trans America](https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/transamerica-trail/) route in Colorado. 

I love Jazz! If you want to talk bebop, pianists, or horn players - let me know. I've been recently really diggin' on [Bud Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O2xMqJH6Z8) for Piano, and [Clifford Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M283JFxesic) for Trumpet.
